Before using the simulation:
1) Copy 3 files in DLL folder
2) Paste them into C:\Program Files\Vector CANoe 16\Exec32 and replace existing DLLs 
(This is for CANoe 16. If you are using CANoe 8.5 you need to replace the DLLs in the respective installation path)

To start the general restbus simulation use one of the following CANoe configurations under /HMI_EVO_V4/Development:
1) For CANoe 8.5: HMI_EVO_MBT_CANoe8.5.cfg
2) For CANoe 16: HMI_EVO - MBT.cfg

The other configurations are for ASIL or DTNA specific testing.
